  demo changes needed to achieve a variation of existing state machine!

  what are more specific requirements for flexibile architecture ?

  Is transcode reusable? with / without redaction?

  How 2 customers can use 2 diff state machines?

  How would you do it without step funcs?

  step func just eliminates SQS .. what else? input / output control?

  verify if it really eliminates SQS

  can express workflow be used to achieve dynamic behaviour
    standard parent calls an express child??

  can a complex state machine be created with few lines of code

  very complex workflows can be created (show state machine graph). Question is can our workflow fit into
  small steps ?
